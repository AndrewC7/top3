      <h1> New York Hot Dog Stand</h1>
      <p> A hot dog stand is a business that sells hot dogs, usually from an external counter. Hot dog stands can be located on a public thoroughfare, near a sports stadium, in a shopping mall, or at a fair. They are often found on the streets of major American cities.[1][2][3] According to one report, some hot dog stands are paying up to $80,000 in rent for prime locations in Manhattan.[4]</p>

      <h1>Dump Truck - Mobile Cuisine</h1>
      <p> When MTV’s reality show “Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory” needed a food truck for the show, La Raza Foods helped them out. Along with the truck itself, La Raza Foods fully stocked the truck with the appropriate items that were needed by Rob Dyrdek and Christopher “Big Black” Boykin. The truck was wrapped in the design uniquely chosen by “Big Black”. Rob’s best friend and sidekick, he chose to have his truck named “Big Black’s Dump Truck”. There is no doubt this truck added a lot of attention, laughter and a good time to the people who experienced the food trucks presence. </p>
